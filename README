All The FFT!

The purpose of this project is to provide a permissively licenced
interface to various C libraries which calculate Discrete Fourier
Transforms.

Currently it provides an interface to:
	* FFTW3 (www.fftw.org)
	* FFTS (www.github.com/anthonix/ffts)
	* Ooura fft4g (www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~ooura/fft.html)
	* GSL (www.gnu.org/software/gsl)
	* Kiss FFT (www.kissfft.sourceforge.net) 
		- should be built with -Dkiss_fft_scalar=double
